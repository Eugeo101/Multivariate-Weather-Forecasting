# Time Series Forecasting Project üìà‚è≥  

This project focuses on forecasting a time-series dataset with **yearly seasonality** and **daily frequency**. The dataset spans from **1/1/2013 to 1/1/2017** and includes four features: **mean temperature**, **humidity**, **wind speed**, and **mean pressure** (with pressure values in 2016 identified as outliers and excluded). The project includes data preprocessing, model evaluation with cross-validation, and predictions using multiple models, including **SARIMA**, **VAR**, **XGBoost**, **Facebook Prophet**, and **LSTM**.

---

## üìù Problem Statement  
Forecast daily values based on the **mean temperature**, **humidity**, and **wind speed** features, while accounting for **yearly seasonality** and handling outliers in the dataset for more accurate future predictions.

---

## üîç Steps Followed  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Understanding  
- The dataset contains **1462 days** with the following features:  
  - **mean temperature (meantemp)**: In Celsius.  
  - **humidity**: Grams of water vapor per cubic meter.  
  - **wind speed**: In km/h.  
  - **mean pressure (meanpressure)**: Atmospheric pressure in atm (excluded 2016 data due to outliers).  

- The data exhibits **yearly seasonality** with nearly zero trend.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing  
- **Missing Values**: Handled using **forward fill**, **backward fill**, and **rolling averages**.  
- **Outlier Removal**: Excluded **mean pressure** due to outliers in 2016.  
- **Differencing**: Applied to remove seasonality and trends for better model performance.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building and Evaluation  

#### Baseline Models:  
- **Naive Forecasting**: Baseline model for comparison.  

#### Advanced Models:  
- **Statistical Models**:  
  - **SARIMA**: Configured with seasonal parameters (`p=d=q=1`) for yearly seasonality.  
  - **VAR**: Set with `maxlags=3` to capture lagged dependencies.  

- **Facebook Prophet**:  
  - Used **yearly seasonality** (`yearly_seasonality=True`) and **holiday data** (`holiday_df`) to account for seasonal effects and holidays.  
  - Plotted seasonal components using `plot_components()`.  

- **Machine Learning Model**:  
  - **XGBoost**: Hyperparameters fine-tuned for optimal performance.  

- **Deep Learning Model**:  
  - **LSTM**: Used with a learning rate of **0.0001** (Adam optimizer), 128 hidden units, and two dense layers (128 ‚Üí 8 ‚Üí 1).  

#### Cross-Validation:  
- Implemented **TimeSeriesSplit** for model validation to ensure a realistic evaluation of time-dependent models.
